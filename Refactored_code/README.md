When the “view form” / “hide form” button is clicked, make the form visible/hidden.
When the submit button is clicked, push the form data into an array.
When we press enter key, push the form data into an array.
Render/Show all the items of the array below the form.
Item should have edit and delete buttons.
When the edit button is clicked, fill data in the form and when submit button is clicked, update the current data.
When the delete button is clicked, remove the item from the list and update the ui.
When the mouse is over the item on the list, change the background color to green.
Change the background color of the items container randomly on the scroll.
Replace the array with localstorage.
BUGS
"Edit" button is working like "hide/show" button. This should not happen.

When edit is pressed, the form is only updating.
